# ITAD-BB-chatbot-for-telco

Application for chatbot presentation on ITAD'17 in Bielsko-Biała / Poland

Demo and competition for the audience in one.

Audience could connect to the application with their smartphones and
give voice commands in the native language. AI engine (wit.ai) was responsible 
to understand sentences and extract the intent + variables

eg. Please recharge my account 123123123 with 12 zł
Send SMS to John 'I will call you later'
Show my invoice for the last month

The concept for the appliaction was to replace couple of TELCO web applications 
(i.e. sms gateway, invoice application, prepaid recharges)
with one conversational interface - the chatbot.

Backend: NodeJS, JavaScript
